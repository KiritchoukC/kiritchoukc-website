      <p class="title">How did I become a developer</p>
      <p class="body-1">
        My name is Cl√©ment, I'm a 25 years old Belgian developer.
      </p>
      <p class="body-1">
        I've started developing when I was 16, I had Java, Web and Managing
        classes. Web classes were about HTML & CSS and some Gimp. And I learned
        VBA in Managing classes.
      </p>
      <p class="body-1">
        I then pursue studying computer sciences where I continue learning Java,
        web technologies, accounting and in depth computer hardware and systems
      </p>
      <p class="body-1">
        While I was looking for work, I got in contact with a company that
        worked with Microsoft technologies. I started learning .NET Framework
        and C# and got hooked.
      </p>
      <p class="body-1">
        And then until now, I continued working with .NET, building apps and
        apis. In my free time I was eager to learn more about other technologies
        like front-end frameworks Angular-React-VueJs, mobile framework like
        Flutter and many more (Docker, SQL, Postgresql, python, Go, GraphQL,
        PWA, ...).
